# PROJECT-NAME

## Overview

A brief description of the project. This should include what problem the project is solving, how it hopes to help, and what tech is involved. Included here are example sections that you should include and you are welcome to add more sections as your project requires.

Any of these sections can be broken out into their own files and linked from these sections if they get too long or unwieldy.

## Setup

A detailed set of instructions to set up the code for the first time.

If CLI commands are involved, they should be included in test blocks.

```sh
# It is good practice to describe what each line does
# Especially for bash commands which can be esoteric
echo "Be helpful to your volunteers"
```

## Contributing

Include rules and expectations that you want volunteers to follow as they work on the project. This especially includes how you want them to use `git`, like branching conventions, branch names, and merging PRs. Also if you are picky about variable names, file names, etc.

If you have a lot of rules, or feel like this section is getting too long, it can be helpful to include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of the project, and to link to it in this section. GitHub recognizes the `CONTRIBUTING.md` filename and will include it when contributors are writing PRs and issues for the first time.

## Testing

Include instructions on how to run your project's tests. Testing is valuable not just to make sure your code is working how you expect it to, but also can be a great way for new contributors to learn what you expect your code to do and can help them acclimate.

## Deployment

Include detailed instructions on how to deploy your code to production. This will probably be more necessary later on in the project, but once you figure it out for the first time, please include it here immediately so you don't have to relearn it the hard way the next time you go to deploy.
